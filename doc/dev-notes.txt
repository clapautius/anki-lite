Behavior
________

Display order
-------------

Studying will show cards from the selected deck, and any sub-decks it contains.

For new cards and reviews, Anki fetches cards from the decks in alphabetical order
(alphabetical order of the decks).

New cards and reviews are fetched separately, and Anki won’t wait until both queues are
empty before moving on to the next deck.

Cards in learning are fetched from all decks at once, because they are somewhat time
critical, and shown in the order they are due.

Card class
----------

- type : 0=new, 1=learning, 2=due

  'New' refers to cards that you have downloaded or entered in, but have never been
  studied before.

  'Learning' refers to cards that were seen for the first time recently, and are still
  being learnt.

  'To Review' (= due?) refers to cards that were previously learnt, and now need to be
  reviewed so you don’t forget them.

- queue : 0 = new, 1 = learning, 2 = due, -1 = suspended, -2 = user buried, -3 = sched
  buried

- due : is used differently for different queues.
  - new queue: note id or random int
  - rev queue: integer day
  - lrn queue: integer timestamp
